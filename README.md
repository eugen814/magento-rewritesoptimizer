magento-rewritesoptimizer
=========================

Magento module for optimizing the way URL rewrites are generated. Depending on configured options, it can exclude invisible and/or disabled products, as well as the store code from URLs, resulting in a smaller and more manageable URL db table. Partly based on AgenceDnd's Patch Index URL module ( found here: http://www.dnd.fr/2012/09/magento-patch-how-to-optimize-re-index-processing-time-for-url-rewrite/ ).
